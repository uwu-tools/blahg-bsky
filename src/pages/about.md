# Welcome to your new blog template!

It extends [cassidoo's](https://cassidoo.co) wonderful [*blahg*](https://github.com/cassidoo/blahg) template with the ability to add comments to posts via Bluesky, which was worked on by [jadeox](https://blog.jade0x.com/post/adding-bluesky-comments-to-your-astro-blog/). Check out [this post](/post/bsky-comments/) to see it in action!

The template uses [Astro](https://astro.build/) and [TinaCMS](https://tina.io/).
You can [clone it on GitHub](https://github.com/uwu-tools/blahg-bsky) to use it for yourself, and see how it works. The GitHub instructions are not completely up-to-date yet, but feel free to file an issue or shoot me a note on [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/auggie.dev)!

The tags at the bottom of the page are dynamically generated. The more tags you use, the more tags are added to the list! Posts are simple markdown files.

Enjoy!

## cassidoo is *v cool*

She would *love* if you told her when you do use *blahg*; she loves seeing variations of it!

You should also check out [her newsletter](https://cassidoo.co/newsletter), or her word game [Jumblie](https://jumblie.com/?utm_campaign=blahgtmp&utm_source=github), or her [GitHub profile](https://github.com/cassidoo). Or don't. Follow your dreams.
